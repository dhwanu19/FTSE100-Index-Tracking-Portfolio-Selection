# README - Index Tracking Portfolio Component: ACTL3182 Assignment

## Project Overview

The **Index Tracking Portfolio** is a key component of the assignment for ACTL3182: Asset-Liability and Derivative Models, Term 3, 2024, at UNSW Sydney. The goal is to construct a portfolio that closely tracks the performance of the **FTSE 100 Index**, which is composed of blue-chip companies listed on the United Kingdom's stock exchange.

### Key Objectives:
- **Minimize Tracking Error**: The primary objective is to replicate the FTSE 100 index as closely as possible, minimizing tracking error, which is the difference in performance between the portfolio and the index.
- **Portfolio Construction**: The portfolio should consist of between 20 and 30 stocks from the London Stock Exchange (LSE).
- **Performance Measurement**: The portfolio's performance will be assessed by its correlation to the FTSE 100 index and the tracking error.

## Portfolio Constraints

- **Stock Selection**: The portfolio must include stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange, with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 20 stocks.
- **Initial Investment**: The portfolio must start with an initial investment of AUD 50,000,000, with necessary currency conversions using the RBA exchange rate data.
- **No Short Selling**: All funds must be fully invested in stocks, without the option to hold cash or engage in short selling.

## Key Performance Metrics

1. **Portfolio Value and Growth**: Track the daily value and growth of the portfolio in dollar terms.
2. **Stock Weights**: Assign appropriate weights to each stock in the portfolio.
3. **Continuous Compounded Growth Rate**: Calculate the continuously compounded percentage growth rate of the portfolio.
4. **Daily Returns and Volatility**: Analyze daily returns and derive per annum expected returns and standard deviations for each stock.
5. **Correlation**: Measure the correlation between the selected stocks in the portfolio.
6. **Risk Analysis**: Compute the mean and standard deviation of the portfolioâ€™s return compared to the FTSE 100 index.
7. **Minimum Variance Set (MVS)**: Identify the minimum variance set for the portfolio and the mean-variance efficient stocks.
8. **Performance Comparison**: Compare portfolio performance against the FTSE 100, using appropriate performance measures.

## Deliverables

1. **PDF Report**: A concise report summarizing key findings and analysis, including:
   - Stock selection rationale.
   - Portfolio performance (value, growth, weights, returns).
   - Risk metrics and correlation analysis.
   - Comparison of portfolio returns with the FTSE 100 index.
   - Minimum variance portfolio analysis.

   The PDF should be formatted as follows:
   - Maximum 5 pages, excluding cover page and appendices.
   - Font: Times New Roman, 12pt.
   - Line spacing: 1.5.

2. **Excel Spreadsheet/R Markdown**: A detailed file containing all calculations, data visualizations, and analytical work for both portfolios.

## Submission Instructions

- **Submission Deadline**: 5th November 2024, 11:59pm.
- **Submission Platform**: Moodle submission box.
- **File Formats**:
  - PDF for the report.
  - Excel or R Markdown for analysis and data visualizations.

## Assessment Criteria

1. **Stock Selection and Rationale** (25 marks): Clear justification for stock inclusion in the portfolio.
2. **Accuracy of Results** (50 marks): Correctness of data, calculations, and analysis in the Excel or R markdown file.
3. **Data Visualization** (20 marks): Quality of visualizations, including graphs and charts that track portfolio performance and key metrics.
4. **Formatting and Presentation** (5 marks): Adherence to formatting requirements and clarity of presentation.
